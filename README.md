1. Fork & clone repository:

Don't forget to ‚≠ê star and fork it first ü§ó
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghbishal/next-js-starter-boilerplate.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üé® Styling and Design System

This boilerplate uses Tailwind CSS for styling and CVA for creating a powerful, easy-to-use design system. If you want to learn more about the setup, check out this fantastic video by Vercel:

### CVA - A New Approach to Variants

While CSS-in-TS libraries such as [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) and [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) are great for building type-safe UI components, they might not be the perfect fit for everyone. You may prefer more control over your stylesheets, need to use a framework like Tailwind CSS, or simply enjoy writing your own CSS.

Creating variants using traditional CSS can be a tedious task, requiring you to manually match classes to props and add types. CVA is here to take that pain away, allowing you to focus on the enjoyable aspects of UI development. By providing an easy and type-safe way to create variants, CVA simplifies the process and helps you create powerful design systems without compromising on the flexibility and control of CSS.

### tailwind-merge 

Utility function to efficiently merge [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) classes in JS without style conflicts.

```ts
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'

twMerge('px-2 py-1 bg-red hover:bg-dark-red', 'p-3 bg-[#B91C1C]')
// ‚Üí 'hover:bg-dark-red p-3 bg-[#B91C1C]'
```

### clsx(...input)

The `clsx` function can take ***any*** number of arguments, each of which can be an Object, Array, Boolean, or String.

> **Important:** _Any_ falsey values are discarded!<br>Standalone Boolean values are discarded as well.

```js
clsx(true, false, '', null, undefined, 0, NaN);
//=> ''
```

### Class Merging

The `cn` located at `utils.ts`. util handles conditional classes and class merging.

```ts
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

```sh
  Input -> cn("px-2 bg-slate-100 py-2 bg-slate-200")
  // Outputs `p-2 bg-slate-200`
```

## üíª Environment Variables handling

[T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/) is a library that provides environmental variables checking at build time, type validation and transforming. It ensures that your application is using the correct environment variables and their values are of the expected type. You‚Äôll never again struggle with runtime errors caused by incorrect environment variable usage.

Config file is located at `env.mjs`. Simply set your client and server variables and import `env` from any file in your project.

```ts
import { createEnv } from '@t3-oss/env-nextjs';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    // Server variables
    SECRET_KEY: z.string(),
  },
  client: {
    // Client variables
    API_URL: z.string().url(),
  },
  runtimeEnv: {
    // Assign runtime variables
    SECRET_KEY: process.env.SECRET_KEY,
    API_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
  },
})
```

If the required environment variables are not set, you'll get an error message:

```sh
  ‚ùå Invalid environment variables: { SECRET_KEY: [ 'Required' ] }
```
